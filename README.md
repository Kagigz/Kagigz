I'm currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft where I work with customers on all sorts of projects, in a team focused on projects related to Data & Artificial Intelligence.

I've experimented with many technologies but right now I mostly use:
- Python & Data Science or Machine Learning related libraries
- Front-end Javascript frameworks: React, Vue, and Jamstack frameworks (Gatsby, Nuxt...)
- Azure technologies: Cognitive Services, Storage, Azure Functions...

My public repos are samples that I think might be useful and random stuff that I want to share, feel free to take a look!
